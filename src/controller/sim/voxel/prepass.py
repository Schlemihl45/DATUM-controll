"""
sim/voxel/prepass.py — full-program collision pre-pass.

Replaces the old per-tick live collision check
(VoxelSimController._check_collision(), removed) with a single, complete,
one-off scan of the WHOLE loaded program that runs in a background thread
(driven by DatumSimWidget, see its docstring on _start_prepass()). The
result is a CollisionPrepassResult — a plain lookup table keyed by path
segment index / G-code line — that on_tick() then reads in O(1) instead of
calling collision.check_segment() itself on every frame.

This is deliberately the same algorithm DatumSimWidget's previous
presim_check_collisions() worker used (fresh, disposable, fully-solid
scratch stock; replay every segment; carve cutting moves into the scratch
copy so later segments see earlier removal, exactly like real playback) —
the only difference is it no longer stops at the first hit: every segment
is checked and every hit recorded, because the result is meant to serve the
*entire* subsequent playback, not just answer "is there a problem at all"
once before a MACHINE start.

Kept independent of Qt/threading concerns on purpose — run_prepass() is a
plain function that only touches numpy/collision.py, so it works the same
whether called from a background thread (the normal case) or synchronously
(e.g. in a test). Cancellation is cooperative: pass a threading.Event and
it is polled periodically; the caller is responsible for not acting on a
None result (returned on cancellation).
