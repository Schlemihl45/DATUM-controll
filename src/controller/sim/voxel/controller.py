"""
sim/voxel/controller.py — VoxelSimController.

Coordinates the High-Water-Mark path dispatch and CPU carving; GPU texture
upload is the caller's responsibility (``grid.upload_if_dirty()``).

High-Water-Mark algorithm
--------------------------
``_max_s`` / ``_max_idx`` track the furthest arc-length (and corresponding
path index) already carved.  Advancing past it carves new segments;
rewinding does not re-carve existing material (the tool cannot un-remove
chips).

Call ``reset()`` to rebuild the stock from scratch (e.g. after the user
presses the Reset button or changes voxel_size).

Collision detection is diagnostic, not a safety interlock, for this
controller (see check_segment()'s rule in collision.py). A hit NEVER stops
carving or advancing the High-Water-Mark — every segment is processed
regardless of its collision result. ``collision_hit`` reflects only the
LAST segment/call processed (live, not sticky): it goes back to None the
moment a clean segment follows a colliding one, which is what drives "tint
the tool red only while it's actually in the collision" in the UI.
``drain_new_hits()`` separately queues every distinct hit exactly once, for
one-shot handling (logging) regardless of how long a given collision's
visual state stays active.

Pre-pass lookup, not a live geometry check (SIM mode)
-------------------------------------------------------
``on_tick()`` (SIM-mode playback) no longer calls collision.check_segment()
itself — that per-frame, per-segment numpy work was the actual cost behind
the old live check. Instead it looks up each segment's collision status
from a ``prepass.CollisionPrepassResult`` computed ONCE, in a background
thread, for the whole program (see ``set_prepass()`` and
``DatumSimWidget._start_prepass()``). Until a result has been injected via
``set_prepass()``, every segment reads as clear — there is deliberately no
"check live until the pre-pass catches up" fallback, since a fallback would
reintroduce the exact per-tick cost this rewrite removes.

``carve_move()`` (MACHINE mode) is unaffected: it still calls
collision.check_segment() directly, live — MACHINE mode has no tessellated
path to pre-scan (see its own docstring).

Thread safety
-------------
``on_tick()`` mutates ``_max_s``/``_max_idx`` and is NOT safe to call
concurrently from two threads.  ``DatumSimWidget`` calls it either
synchronously from the Qt main thread (small per-tick backlogs) or from a
single background worker thread (large backlogs) — never both at once: a
new call is only ever dispatched once any previous background worker has
fully finished, so at any instant there is exactly one caller. The GPU
upload (``grid.upload_if_dirty()``) must be called with the GL context
current — the caller (``DatumSimWidget._tick`` / ``_drive_voxel_carve`` /
``_force_carve_catchup``) is responsible for ``makeCurrent()``.
``carve_move()`` (MACHINE mode) runs on a separate background thread from
``on_tick()`` (never concurrently with it — MACHINE and SIM mode are
mutually exclusive) but DOES run concurrently with the main/GL thread
draining ``drain_new_hits()`` — that method's list-swap is a single,
GIL-atomic rebind, the same lock-free idiom ``gpu_grid.py``'s
``_dirty_tiles`` snapshot uses, for the same reason.
