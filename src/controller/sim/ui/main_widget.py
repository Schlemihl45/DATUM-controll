"""
sim/ui/main_widget.py — DatumSimWidget: 3D G-code viewer + sim player.

Composes:
  • Viewport       — ModernGL OpenGL widget (G-code path + tool)
  • SettingsPanel  — right-edge slide-out with functional sim settings
  • ControlHub     — bottom-centre playback bar + info labels

All three are positioned as overlays on top of the viewport via
_layout_overlays(), which is called from resizeEvent and open/close panel
actions so the geometry always stays correct.

Voxel material-removal simulation
----------------------------------
When the C++ extension is gone, the voxel sim is implemented entirely in
Python + numpy (carver.py / gpu_grid.py) with a GLSL raymarching renderer
(renderer.py).  All objects (GpuVoxelGrid, VoxelCarver, VoxelSimController,
VoxelRenderer) require an active GL context and are therefore created lazily
after the viewport's initializeGL fires.

Public interface (mirrors SimPlaceholder so machine_page.py can swap freely):
    set_file(path)              — load and compile a G-code file
    set_mode("SIM"|"MACHINE")  — sim player vs. live machine follow
    set_state(state_str)        — string state label (passed through)
    set_position(x, y, z)      — push live machine position (MACHINE mode)
    set_line(line)              — highlight a G-code line
    sim_play/pause/reset/seek/set_speed — simulation playback controls
